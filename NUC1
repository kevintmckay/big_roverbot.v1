ASSESSMENT: NOT SUITABLE FOR ROBOT BRAIN
=========================================

This NUC (DCP847SKE) does NOT meet the hardware requirements for the
RoverBot v1 robot brain. Hardware limitations are fixed and cannot
be resolved through software/OS changes.

CRITICAL HARDWARE LIMITATIONS
-----------------------------
1. CPU Performance
   - 2 cores vs 4 required
   - 1.1GHz fixed vs 2.0-2.9GHz required
   - ~3-4x slower single-thread
   - ~6-8x slower multi-thread
   - Cannot run Nav2 + SLAM + vision simultaneously

2. No OpenVINO Support
   - Sandy Bridge GPU lacks OpenVINO acceleration
   - No AVX instructions for optimized inference
   - Real-time object detection not feasible

3. Insufficient RAM (not upgradeable)
   - 8GB vs 32GB required
   - At maximum capacity for this board

4. Storage Limitations
   - SATA only (no NVMe slot)
   - 120GB vs 2TB required
   - Upgradeable but still slower interface

5. No WiFi
   - Would need USB adapter for wireless

PERFORMANCE ESTIMATES

YOLOv8n inference       | 200-400ms (2-5 FPS)  | 30-50ms (20-33 FPS)
SLAM (slam_toolbox)     | Marginal, may lag    | Real-time capable
Nav2 path planning      | 1-2 sec latency      | <100ms latency
Gazebo simulation       | Not usable           | Usable
Concurrent ROS2 nodes   | 3-4 max              | 10+ feasible

Effective Compute       | 1x baseline          | ~10x for robotics

RECOMMENDED USE
---------------
NUC1 is NOT suitable as the robot brain but could serve as:

1. Development Workstation
   - Code editing
   - Git operations
   - Documentation

2. Support Server
   - Remote monitoring dashboard
   - Network file storage (with larger SSD)
   - Log aggregation

3. Fleet Coordination
   - If expanding to multiple robots
   - Non-real-time task scheduling
   - Central configuration management

4. Build Server
   - Cross-compilation for ARM targets
   - CI/CD for lightweight tasks

NOTES
-----
- This is a 2012-era NUC, 9 years older than NUC2
- Power consumption is higher (17W vs 10W) despite lower performance
- Form factor is similar to NUC2 but not identical
- Could be repurposed but not as primary robot compute
