NETWORK
-------
Interfaces: eno1 (ethernet), docker0, br-7c91c485fcf2

ASSESSMENT: NOT SUITABLE
========================

This server is an older Intel NUC from 2012 and does NOT match the hardware
documented in the project README. Critical limitations:

1. CPU Performance
   - 2 cores vs 4 cores required
   - 1.1GHz vs 2.0-2.9GHz required
   - ~3-4x slower single-thread, ~6-8x slower multi-thread
   - Cannot run Nav2 + SLAM + vision simultaneously

2. No OpenVINO Support
   - Sandy Bridge GPU lacks OpenVINO acceleration
   - No AVX instructions for optimized inference
   - YOLOv8n would run at <5 FPS (vs 20-33 FPS on N5105)
   - Real-time object detection not feasible

3. Insufficient RAM
   - 8GB vs 32GB required
   - ROS2 Jazzy + Nav2 + Gazebo needs 16GB minimum
   - No headroom for vision models

4. Storage Limitations
   - 120GB vs 2TB required
   - SATA vs NVMe (slower)
   - Insufficient for rosbag recordings, maps, training data

5. OS Compatibility
   - Debian 13 not officially supported by ROS2 Jazzy
   - Would need Ubuntu 24.04 for proper ROS2 support

PERFORMANCE ESTIMATES (this server)
-----------------------------------
Task                    | Estimate
------------------------|------------------
YOLOv8n inference       | 200-400ms (2-5 FPS)
SLAM (slam_toolbox)     | Marginal, may lag
Nav2 path planning      | Slow, 1-2 sec latency
Gazebo simulation       | Not usable
Concurrent ROS2 nodes   | 3-4 max before issues

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
This server (DCP847SKE) should NOT be used as the robot brain.

Options:
1. Acquire the NUC specified in README (Intel NUC11 with N5105)
2. Use a Raspberry Pi 5 for basic operation (reduced capability)
3. Use this server only for:
   - Code development/editing
   - Remote monitoring dashboard
   - Network file storage
   - Non-real-time data processing

The DCP847SKE could serve as a secondary server for fleet coordination
(Option B in README) but lacks the compute for on-robot autonomy.

HARDWARE UPGRADE PATH
---------------------
If upgrading this specific board:
- Max RAM: 8GB (already at limit)
- CPU: Soldered (not upgradeable)
- Storage: Can add larger SATA SSD

Conclusion: Replace, don't upgrade. The NUC11 with N5105 provides
approximately 10x the effective robotics compute capability.
